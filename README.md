# SpawnGridMap Demo

This project is a demo for how to use the [SpawnGridMap](https://github.com/daleblackwood/SpawnGridMap) addon for Godot. This demo contains a single scene, meshlibrary and reference implentation for spawning instances in GridMaps.

The SpawnGridMap files included are submoduled, so be sure to pull that down with the repository.
